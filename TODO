Install IRAF. This can be IRAF 2.16v from NOAO or the community version (possibly harder to install but better).
For the community version: download the latest stable build in the IRAF-community github repository.
sudo apt-get install tcsh libxss1 lib32z1 lib32ncurses5 libbz2-1.0:i386 libxmu6:i386
Follow the documentation to install IRAF.
Download binaries for x11IRAF and install them (using tcsh) or compile them from source (last resource).
Download binaries for ds9 (do not use version 7.6).
Download more IRAF packages. (The extern folder in the IRAF directory still has the installation script. However, it seems that NOAO has dropped development. Finding a mirror or compiling from source seems to be the only way).
